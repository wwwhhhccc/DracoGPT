content: You are presented with a partial specification for a visualization. Your task is to complete this design in an optimal manner so that people can read the visualization quickly and accurately. You rely upon visualization design best practices and principles from graphical perception research to make your recommendation. Ensure that your completion fully respects the provided partial specification.

content: Below is the partial specification of a visualization. This dictionary specification contains summary statistics about the three variables to be visualized (q1, q2, and n) and some information about the design of the visualization. q1 and q2 are quantitative variables and n is a categorical variable.
You should suggest a completion of the design of this visualization in Vega-Lite that meets the following requirements:
(1) The full design must FULLY respect the partial specification, including, but not limited to, the coordinate system, mark type, encoding channels, and scales, whenever they are provided;
(2) EVERY encoding channel you see in the partial specification, either in "encoding" or "scale", must be used in your recommendation to encode one variable;
(3) The full design must use EXACTLY THREE encoding channels, ONE EACH for q1, q2, and n, and these three channels must include ALL encoding channels (including any facets) present in the partial specification;
(4) The full design should best support readers to perform a value task involving q1. In a value task, readers need to read or compare individual visual marks. In our case, examples of a value task involving q1 include retrieving the value for q1 of a clearly labeled data point and comparing the values for q1 of two clearly labeled data points;
(5) The full design must not perform data aggregation--it should render the individual data points in a way that makes it easy for readers to mentally perform the value task.
Here is the partial specification:
 

{"task": "value", "number_rows": 90, "field": [{"name": "n", "type": "string", "entropy": 1000, "unique": 3}, {"name": "q1", "type": "number", "entropy": 1344, "unique": 90, "interesting": "true"}, {"name": "q2", "type": "number", "entropy": 3956, "unique": 90}], "view": {"coordinates": "cartesian", "mark": [{"type": "point"}], "encoding": [{"channel": "x", "field": "n"}], "scale": [{"channel": "y", "type": "linear", "zero": "true"}, {"channel": "x", "type": "ordinal"}]}}

Your response must exactly be a single JSON object with two keys: "chart" and "reason". For "chart", provide the completion in Vega-Lite. You may omit the data field.  For "reason", provide a one-sentence rationale for why you think this is the best completion. It is paramount that all the requirements above are strictly met.

  "reason": "Using the x-axis for the categorical variable 'n' and the y-axis for the quantitative variable 'q1' allows for easy comparison of 'q1' values, while encoding 'q2' with color differentiates the data points without adding additional complexity."
