Your response must exactly be a single JSON object with two keys: "chart" and "reason". For "chart", provide the completion in python using the visualization library altair. You must omit the import statement and the data field in alt.Chart(). For "reason", provide a one-sentence rationale for why you think this is the best completion. It is paramount that all the requirements above are strictly met.
